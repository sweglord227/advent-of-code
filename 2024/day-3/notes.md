happy (late) birthday to me!!
this was a bit easier than i expected (tho it took me a while lmao)
i started this after my birthday party and it took me until the day after
to get it done lol.

i know i could've used regex, but i've never touched it
before and i figured "today is not that day". if it comes up again, and 
earlier in the day, i'll look into it and see if i can use it in rust somehow.

in other news i both wished for, and made, a `split_at_str` function for Strings.
it went through like 3 different iterations, first **just** being in the `find_all_between`
function, then just giving the first slice, then giving both the first and last halves.

i also stumbled into the `Searcher` trait from `String::into_searcher` and i
really wish that was finished **before** i started this, but alas. what's done is 
done and this is very much done.
